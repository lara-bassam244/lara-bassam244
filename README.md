 Hi there 👋
 
I'm Lara, a software engineer and Computer Science student who loves designing clean user interfaces and turning ideas into real, working products. I enjoy building modern, responsive web applications using React and Next.js.

I’m preparing for graduation and focusing on strengthening my skills in the tools I use daily. I’m also refining my full-stack projects and improving my overall development workflow.

Tools I use: 

React · Next.js · TypeScript · Node.js · Express · MongoDB · Firebase · GitHub · Docker · Figma · Blender

A Bit About Me
